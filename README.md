# Galytix-Api
Developed an API Request which passes string and create data in CSV file.
We use Get Api to retrive the application data and hardcord the values of country name and bussinessname so we get the value of entire row and after that we select the year 2008 to year 2015 and use inbuilt function for average the number and returning to console. 
Beside of these technology we use C# web API for completion of task.
